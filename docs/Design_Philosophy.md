Disco Elysium, it is best described as a form of "Digital Oil-Based Expressionism" that prioritizes psychological depth and emotional texture over realistic depiction.

The distinctive and acclaimed portraits, primarily the work of lead artist Aleksander Rostov, are a core component of the game's identity. Their design philosophy is a deliberate fusion of classical art influences and a modern, digital approach aimed at externalizing the characters' inner turmoil, history, and personality.

Key elements of this design philosophy include:

Painterly Brushwork: The portraits are characterized by visible, bold, and often thick brushstrokes, mimicking the impasto technique used in oil painting. This creates a sense of texture and physicality, as if the character's personality has been sculpted onto the canvas.

Psychological Realism: Instead of photorealism, the artists aimed for a deeper psychological truth. Features are often subtly distorted, fragmented, or exaggerated to reflect a character's mental state, biases, and the protagonist's own fractured perception of them. A character's internal conflict might manifest as disjointed planes on their face or chaotic energy in the brushwork.

Fragmented and Living Color: The artists intentionally avoided flat colors. A character's skin tone is a complex landscape of unexpected huesâ€”blues, greens, pinks, and yellows. This technique, mentioned by the developers, is meant to give a "disproportionate amount of color" to the world, suggesting depth and a history that lies just beneath the surface. It makes the portraits feel vibrant and unstable, as if the light is constantly shifting.

Influence of Classical Portraiture: Aleksander Rostov has cited painters like Ilya Repin, a master of Russian realism, as well as expressionists and impressionists. There are also clear nods to artists like Francis Bacon in the way the portraits can feel distorted and emotionally raw, and Rembrandt in the dramatic use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) to create mood.

Deconstruction of the Subject: Many portraits appear unfinished or as if they are dissolving into the background. This is a deliberate choice that reflects the game's themes of decay, memory, and the "Pale," a mysterious force that slowly dissolves reality. The portraits are not static images but representations of a person's struggle against their own internal and external dissolution.

In essence, the design philosophy is not to show you what a character looks like, but to make you feel who they are. Each portrait is a dialogue, a subjective impression filtered through the broken mind of the protagonist, rendered in a style that is as complex, messy, and beautiful as the characters themselves.
